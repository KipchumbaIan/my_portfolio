        <p >Ian Kipchumba had always been fascinated by how things worked. Growing up, 
            he would take apart machines just to understand their inner workings. 
            This curiosity led him to study mechanical engineering, a field where precision, 
            design, and problem-solving ruled.

            After years of hard work, he landed a role at Interbuild Engineering, 
            where he tackled complex engineering challenges daily. But deep inside,
             another passion was brewing—coding. He saw how technology was transforming industries, 
             and he wanted to be part of that revolution.
            
            Determined to bridge the gap between engineering and software, Ian enrolled at PLP Academy,
             immersing himself in the world of programming. Every line of code felt like solving an engineering puzzle
              and soon, he was building applications that blended both his mechanical expertise and newfound coding skills.
            
            His journey had just begun, but one thing was clear—Ian wasn’t just following a path;
             he was creating his own. A future where engineering and software met seamlessly,
              and he was at the forefront of it.</p>
